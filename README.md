# 🗒️ Simple File-Based Notes App

A lightweight note-taking application built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and the File System module. Designed for backend beginners, this app lets you easily create, view, and delete text notes—each stored as a `.txt` file on the server. No databases, just handy file storage.
